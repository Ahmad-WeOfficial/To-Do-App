# To-Do-App:

The To-Do App is a simple, user-friendly application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to create, manage, and delete tasks in a to-do list. Tasks can be marked as completed, helping users keep track of their daily activities. 

# Technologies Used:

HTML: Provides the structure for the to-do app, including input forms, task list display, and buttons for interaction.
CSS: Used for styling the appâ€™s interface, making it visually appealing and user-friendly. CSS ensures the app is responsive, adapting to different screen sizes.
JavaScript: Handles the app's functionality, such as adding, removing, and toggling tasks between completed and pending states. JavaScript also allows for interaction with the DOM (Document Object Model) to update the task list dynamically.

# How It Works:

HTML: The app consists of a basic layout with a text input for new tasks, an "Add Task" button to submit tasks, and a list area where all tasks are displayed. Each task has options to mark it as completed or delete it.
CSS: The styling is designed to provide a clean and user-friendly experience. Each task is styled based on its state (completed or pending). The app is fully responsive, so it adjusts the layout for different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth user experience on both mobile and desktop.
Completed tasks can be styled with a strikethrough, background color, or other indicators to visually distinguish them from pending tasks.
JavaScript:
Add Task: When the user enters a new task and clicks the "Add Task" button, JavaScript dynamically adds the task to the list and updates the display.
Mark as Completed: When a user clicks on a task, JavaScript toggles its state between completed and pending. Completed tasks can be visually marked with a strikethrough or color change.
Delete Task: Each task has a delete button that allows users to remove the task from the list. JavaScript listens for this event and removes the task from the DOM.
